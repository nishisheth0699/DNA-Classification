## Overview

DNA classification is a critical task in bioinformatics, enabling researchers and practitioners to:
- Categorize DNA sequences into functional groups.
- Identify genetic mutations linked to diseases.
- Enhance drug discovery processes in pharmacogenomics.

This project focuses on building a robust pipeline to preprocess raw DNA sequences, visualize sequence characteristics, train machine learning models, and classify sequences based on biological properties.
